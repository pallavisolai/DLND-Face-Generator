# DLND-Face-Generator
Generative Adversarial Networks used to generate new images of faces.

Each code cell contains information about the code written.

## Dataset

Two datasets are used in this project:

- MNIST
- CelebA

### [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits are size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

### [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including

- 10,177 number of identities
- 202,599 number of face image and
- 5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.

The dataset can be employed as the training and test sets for the following computer vision tasks: face attribute recognition, face detection, and landmark (or facial part) localization.
